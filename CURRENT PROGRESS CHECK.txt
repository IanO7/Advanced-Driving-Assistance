	Detection: Only cars (COCO class 2) and pedestrians (COCO class 0) are identified and visualized.
Car logic:
Collision warning (red): Only for the single car directly in front (closest to the bottom center of the frame) if it is within the collision threshold.
Front car (orange): The car directly in front (closest to bottom center), if not in collision range.
Other cars (green): All other detected cars, regardless of position (side, far, etc.).
Pedestrian logic:
Pedestrian alert (magenta): Only for pedestrians close to the front car (within a set pixel threshold).
Other pedestrians (cyan): All other detected pedestrians.
Restrictions:
Collision and pedestrian alerts are only for the car and pedestrians directly in front, not for those on the sides or behind.
Only one car is considered the “front car” for collision and pedestrian proximity checks.

DOCUMENTATON BELOW IMPORTANT + UNDERSTANDING!



-ABOVE IS YOLO ultralytics


-BELOW IS OPENCV
-Lane warning, need to make better now doesnt detect very well in both hgreen & line cases


-PERODUA FEATURWS BELOW
-etection of pedestrian & vehicle collision
-Front departure alert
-lane departure warning
-


**BASED ON PEDESTRIAN RUSHING VIDEO, COLLISION ALERT IS GOOD perfect detected SO JJUST MINOR TWEAK PERGEVY FOR PEDESRIAN AND CAR SENSITIVITY ONLY, THEN LDW LATER EASYT
**ALERTS SHOULD BE BASED ON POSSIBLE COLLISION SO FRONT CLOSE, SIDE CAN BE IGNORED SINCE WONT ALERT IF ONCOMING  BUT COMING INTO FRONT LANE WILL! (SIDE IS ONLY IDENTIFIED)

-High threshold detects more, lower threshold detects less since range being considered
-Bottom bonnet, then increase threshold to alert (else too low wont alert), but not bonnet low threshold will already alert
	=> BECAUSE IF BONNET THEN LARGER RANGE TO CONSIDER SNCE BOTTOM OF SCREEN TO CAR IS LARGER BUT ACTUALLY VERY CLOSE (upper top) & IF NO BONNET THEN ACTUAL IS JSUT THAT SHORT RANGE 
	=> CODE IMPORTANT NOTE TO ADD ALREADY IMPLEMENTED IS RED/GREEN/ORANGE IS FRONT CAR AND COLLISIONS BUT REFERENCING BOTTOM CENTER OF SCREEN (HENCE BONNET CHANGES ETC, CALIBRATION REQUIRED, BUT NO FIXED OBJ ACTUALLY IN VIDEO NEEDED)
